# faceRecognition


Developed a Facial Expression Detection using keras, The objective is to classify each face based on the emotions shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (Angry,Disgust,Fear,Happy,Sad,Surprise, Neutral). I used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once the model is trained, saved, and exported the CNN, I will the output of my model through a web interface.
